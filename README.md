# jump-to-alternative README

This extension registers 1 command that will toggle view between source file and test file associated with it.

## Features

When the command is issued, your editor will jump to the alternative file if the extension is able to find one.
It will try to find file with the same name as close to the current one as possible within subtree.
Press `ALT` + `T` to jump between files

### Acknowledgements

This extension is based on Blake Herrington's [vscode-jump-to-test](https://github.com/blakeherrington/vscode-jump-to-test).
It was cloned instead of forked because It needs to be published for my usecases

**Enjoy!**
